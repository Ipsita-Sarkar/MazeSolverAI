A GUI based maze solving project.
Dijkstra's Algorithm is used to find the shortest path.
Language used is Python.
Tkinter Library is used for creating user interface.
The project contains 3 code files.

app.py: It connects the frontend and backend. It contains the code for user interface.Run this file to see the output.

logic.py: It contains the code for the algorithm used to find the minimum path between two vertices.

maze.py: It contains the code for creating the maze.
